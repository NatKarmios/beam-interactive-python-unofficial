# beam-interactive-python-unofficial
An unofficial fork of Beam's interactive Python library

This *should* fix the existing problem of being unable to send progress updates, as well as being a little more user-friendly in general.

I will attempt to document and possibly optimise this in the future, but for the moment, you can refer to `example.py` for a simple usage example.

*Note: I am 17 and relatively inexperienced. As a result, most if not all of this code is probably riddled with bad practice.*<br>
*Please do let me know of any possible improvements you may spot, and I will do my best to make them so.*<br>
*Feel free to contact me, I'm @NatKarmios on Twitter and Nat#1581 on Discord.*
